CTF tournaments are traditionally held in two formats: in the Task-Based (or Jeopardy) format, players are given a set of tasks
to which they must find and submit an answer. The answer is given in the form of a flag consisting of a set of symbols or a random phrase.
For the correct completion of each task, the team receives points. The more difficult the task, the more points are given for the correct answer.
